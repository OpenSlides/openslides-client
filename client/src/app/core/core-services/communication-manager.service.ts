/**
 * Main class for communication in streams with the server. You have first to register an
 * endpoint to communicate with by calling `registerEndpoint` and connect to it with `connect`.
 *
 * Note about some behaviours:
 * - The returned function must be called to close the stream.
 * - The fact that `connect` returns does not mean, that we are connected. Maybe we are offline
 *   since offline-handling is managed by this service
 * - When going offline every connection is closed and attempted to reconnect when going
 *   online. This implies that for one connect, multiple requests can be done.
 *   -> Make sure that the streams are build in a way, that it handles reconnects.
